# FORMS
This repository contains the FORMS (Frame Of Reference Map of Salience) spatial module for ACT-R and two demonstration tasks and models.  spatial.lisp -- This is the FORMS spatial module for ACT-R. Simply load it into your Lisp environment before loading your model. Also, placing it into your ACT-R installation's "modules" folder will make it load automatically with the rest of ACT-R. perceptual-model.lisp -- This is the demonstration perceptual model. It demonstrates how the FORMS spatial module works in a very simple visual task. perceptual-task.lisp -- This is the task to give the perceptual model something to work with. Call (do-exp) to run it. retrieval-model.lisp -- This is the demonstration retrieval model. The model studies the same stimuli as in the perceptual task, but then the stimuli disappear and the model responds from declarative memory of spatial representations. retrieval-task.lisp -- This is the task to give the retrieval model something to work with. Call (do-exp) to run it.
